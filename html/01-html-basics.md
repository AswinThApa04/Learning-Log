## 🌐 What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It defines the **structure and content** of a web document using tags.

- HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers.
- It consists of elements enclosed within angle brackets like `<tag>`.
- It is **not case-sensitive** (`<h1>` is same as `<H1>`).

| `<b>`     | Bold text                   |
| `<i>`     | Italic text                 |
| `<u>`     | Underlined text             |
| `<pre>`   | Preserves formatting        |
| `<big>`   | Makes text slightly bigger  |
| `<small>` | Makes text slightly smaller |

### Example:
```html
<b>This is bold</b>
<i>This is italic</i>
<u>This is underlined</u>
<pre>

```
